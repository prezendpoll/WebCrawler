# WebCrawler
A web crawler that generates random domain names (.com, .org, .net) and retrieves page titles, descriptions, and internal links. It uses NLP to summarize content and stores the findings in a CSV file. Features include recursive link exploration and rate-limiting to prevent server overload. Ideal for data collection and analysis.
